  "summary": "Core Valentine UI appears to be implemented in frontend/src/App.tsx with a Yes-result view that renders the required static images. However, the diff also introduces authentication/actor/query infrastructure and a backend canister stub that were explicitly non-goals and violate the “do not edit/add under these paths” constraints. The required generated image asset files themselves are not shown as added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add the required generated images to the project as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated with the exact filenames, and render them via static paths (no backend fetch).",
      "reason": "The UI references /assets/generated/*.png, but the diff summary does not show the required image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (references /assets/generated/hearts-pattern-bg.dim_1920x1080.png and /assets/generated/good-choice-meme.dim_800x600.png)",

      "reason": "Non-goals include user accounts/authentication (including Internet Identity). Constraints also explicitly forbid editing files under frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts and frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts and frontend/src/main.tsx, yet these paths are present as added files and wired into the app.",

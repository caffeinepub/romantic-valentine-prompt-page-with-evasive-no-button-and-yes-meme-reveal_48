  "summary": "Diff implements a new three-view flow (prompt → meme → title) and adds a dedicated title view that renders the exact text \"NABIHA SHINWARI LOVE YOU\" with new hero-style gradient/glow typography in global CSS. However, the provided App.tsx diff is truncated, so it’s not confirmable from the evidence that the meme screen includes a clear \"Next/Continue\" control or that the shared background wrapper is consistently applied to the prompt and meme views.",

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Provide a clear, simple way to proceed from the first post-Yes meme screen to the second title screen (e.g., a \"Next\"/\"Continue\" button), without breaking the existing romantic theme and background pattern.",
      "reason": "While App.tsx defines `handleContinueToTitle` and a `title` view, the diff snippet does not show the meme view UI containing an obvious button/control to proceed to the title screen, and the file is truncated before the meme view is shown.",

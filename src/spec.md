## Summary
**Goal:** After clicking “Yes! 💕”, let the user proceed through a meme screen to a distinct second screen that prominently displays the exact title text “NABIHA SHINWARI LOVE YOU” in a stylish, big-screen-friendly design.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the post-“Yes! 💕” flow to include a distinct second screen/view within the same React app.
- Keep the existing meme screen after “Yes! 💕”, and add a clear “Next”/“Continue” control to navigate from the meme screen to the title screen.
- Add a title screen that renders the exact text “NABIHA SHINWARI LOVE YOU” with large, high-contrast, decorative-but-readable “stylish alphabet” typography and responsive centering.
- Ensure the romantic theme and hearts background pattern remain consistent across the prompt screen, meme screen, and title screen, with all other UI text staying in English.

**User-visible outcome:** Clicking “Yes! 💕” shows the meme screen with an obvious way to continue, and then navigates to a second screen that displays “NABIHA SHINWARI LOVE YOU” prominently in a stylish, responsive hero title.
